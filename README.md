# Drone control with hand gestures using image processing

Drone control with hand gestures using image processing is a project I realized in the seventh semester of my studies
as a bachelor thesis at the Wroclaw University of Technology in the field of Control Engineering and Robotics.

## The purpose and scope of the project

The main purpose of the project is to create an application that would allow you to control the drone using hand gestures.
Gesture recognition will be realized by processing the image from the drone's built-in camera. Detection
of particular gestures will result in the drone performing appropriate movement actions.

## Tasks

- [x] Design of the graphical interface of the application.
- [x] Implementation of hand gesture recognition.
- [x] Manually controlling the drone via the app.
- [x] Controlling the drone with hand gestures.
- [x] Integration of functionalities.
- [x] Testing the application.
